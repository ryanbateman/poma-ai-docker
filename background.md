# Poma AI Project Summary

## Overview
[POMA AI](https://www.poma-ai.com/) is a platform designed to optimize **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipelines through **intelligent chunking**. It aims to solve common issues in RAG such as low retrieval accuracy, high token costs, and AI hallucinations by providing a more semantic and context-aware approach to processing documents.

## Key Features

### Intelligent Chunking
Unlike traditional fixed-size chunking, Poma AI divides content into meaningful "chunksets" that preserve semantic hierarchy and contextual integrity. This approach:
- Preserves verbatim text.
- Determines optimal chunk sizes automatically.
- Maintains full context fidelity.

### Benefits
- **Token Reduction**: Claims up to **90% reduction** in input context tokens.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Lower token usage translates to significant cost savings.
- **Accuracy**: Reduces hallucinations and improves retrieval precision (0% AI-induced bias).
- **Compliance**: "100% Compliance Ready" with structured retrieval suitable for high-stakes domains (Legal, Finance, etc.).

### Integration
- **SDK**: Offers a lightweight SDK for integration into existing workflows.
- **Compatibility**: Works with major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic) and Vector Databases (Pinecone, Weaviate).
- **Plugins**: Supports LangChain and LlamaIndex.
- **Deployment**: Available via API, Cloud, and On-premise.
